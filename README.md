# CyberSecurity Boot Camp

## Overview
This Repo is to record my journey in the ITI Summer training. I only put the Tasks and their Answers in this repo because there were a lot of days where the teaching was without slides, just an experienced instructor explaining and teaching us some topics with his knowledge

### How to Use

1. **Required Tasks**: This folder contains some of the tasks that are required to complete the boot camp.
2. **Answers**: This folder contains the corresponding answers or solutions to the tasks.

#### It doesn't include all the tasks or the material used due to copy rights ...
